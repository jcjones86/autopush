== AutoPush ==

Pushes changes to a remote directory via rsync. Configure local and remote
directories in config.yml.


== REQUIREMENTS ==

 * Mac OS X (Uses FSEvents API)
 * RubyCocoa
 * Ruby 1.8.x (Ruby 1.9.x doesn't work with RubyCocoa)
 * fsevents gem
   * http://rubygems.org/gems/fsevents
   * https://github.com/ymendel/fsevents


== HOW TO USE ==

You can run this via:
  ruby autopush.rb

To run as a daemon:
  ruby autopush_daemon.rb start

To stop daemon:
  ruby autopush_daemon.rb stop

NOTE: If you have installed Ruby 1.9.x and it is in your PATH,
  make sure the scripts have executable rights (chmod 0700) and run
  them as shell scripts: ./autopush.rb. I've chosen to use '#!/usr/bin/ruby'
  instead of '#!/usr/bin/env ruby' for this reason.

  Alternatively, you can use Ruby Version Manager (http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/)
  to handle Ruby versions.
